# Announcement Website

Announcement Website created for Computer Science 11 (ICS 3U0). We were told to make an website for an announcement system that could be used in school.

### What can it do?

Allows teachers to create and edit announcements that are visible to students and other teacherments. There is also a filtering system to priotize certain announcements over others, there is also an override feature to force the display of certain announcements. Contains the most basic, barebones login system.
