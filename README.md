# Announcement Website

An announcement website created for an announcement system that could be used in my high school, as a replacement of the outdated speaker system.

### What can it do?

Allows teachers to create and edit announcements that are visible to students and other teacherments. There is also a filtering system to priotize certain announcements over others, there is also an override feature to force the display of certain announcements. Contains the most basic, barebones login system.
